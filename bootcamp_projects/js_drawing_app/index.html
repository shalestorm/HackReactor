    <h1>DOMatello</h1>

    The paint program of the future!


    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>
    <h3>Part 1 - Warm up steps:</h3>
    </p>
    <p>1. Review the code in 'myApp.js'</p>
    <p>2. Open the console in your browser</p>
    <p>3. Update the code so that clicking on anywhere on the "canvas" below pops up an alert with a message</p>
    <p>4. Remove the alert, and modify above code to console log the event object, and the event.target</p>
    <p>4b. Update the code so it only console logs if the target is one of the divs in the "canvas"</p>

    <p>
    <h3>Part 2 - Coloring a square (write code to do the following):</h3>
    </p>
    <p>5. When a user clicks on a square, change it's background color to 'cyan'</p>
    <p>6. When a user clicks on a square, change it's background color to 'magenta' if the color is already 'cyan'</p>
    <p>7. When a user clicks on a square, change it's background color to 'yellow' if the color is already 'magenta'</p>
    <p>8. When a user clicks on a square, change it's background color to 'cyan' if the color is already 'yellow'</p>
    <p>9. When a user "double clicks" on a square, change it's background color to 'white'</p>
    <p>10. Add a text input where a user can type in the color they want to have instead of 'cyan'.
        Note that this is for practice only, in a real world scenario inputs from the
        users should be sanitized and validated
    </p>

    <p>
    <h3>Part 3 - DOMatello (write code to do the following):</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: If you'd like to experiment and do something different here, we
        encourage it, just please let your instructor know and get approval
        before proceeding. Go wild, have fun!
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>11. Create a color pallette: Add a row of squares with different background colors for the user to pick</p>
    <p>12. Add a single square at the start or end of the pallette to represent the current color, give it a solid black
        border</p>
    <p>13. When a user clicks on a square in the pallette, show the picked color by updating the "current color square"
        background color to match</p>
    <p>14. When a user clicks on a square in the "canvas", change it's background color to the picked color</p>
    <p>15. Add mouse move: Update the code so that once a square on the "canvas" is clicked, simply moving the mouse
        changes the background color</p>
    <p>16. Update the code so clicking <em>again</em>, deactivates coloring on mouse move</p>
    <p>17. Add a button that clears the canvas</p>
