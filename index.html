                <p>Hello! I'm Skyler, a passionate coder and gamer. I love working on creative projects that blend tech
                    and
                    fun.
                    When I'm not coding, you can find me playing tabletop games or spending too much time at my
                    computer.
                    <br><br>Currently im enrolled in a coding bootcamp through Hack Reactor, but i also have a college
                    background
                    In Computer science.

                <h2>Performance Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    I started to take piano lessons when i was 9 years old, and have been playing ever since.
                    In my gradeschool years i picked up the trumpet as a part of band class, and play that to this day
                    as well.
                    <br>In highschool i eventually joined both marching band, and jazz band, in addition to our
                    Orchestral band.
                    Though I primarily stuck with trumpet, the skillset and love led to me to try multiple other brass
                    instruments,
                    such as trombone, and the french horn.
                    I never quite fell in love with read instruments the same way as brass, however i did take the time
                    to learn enough
                    to get in trouble on the sax. The same is true of string instruments, of which i have
                    dabbled in guitar, mandolin, and violin.
                    <br>In addition to my love of music, I also have a passion for acting.
                    I also have a love of improv, and have been a part of multiple improv groups.
                    <br>Though these are largely passion driven skills. The tools i have learned from them have
                    been invaluable.
                    I have learned how to work as a team, as well as develop fleshed out social skills.

                <p>
                    I have a wide range of interests, but my main focus is on gaming and coding. I love to play
                    tabletop games, especially Dungeons and Dragons. I also enjoy playing video games, particularly
                    RPGs and Roguelikes.
                    <br><br>When I'm not gaming or working on a project, I like to spend my time reading, watching
                    movies, and spending time
                    with Cats - Joker &amp; Mona - And my wife Miranda!

                </div>
                <h2>Favorite games</h2>
                <p>Firstly I always advise to check out my <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/_shale_/"
                        target="_blank">Steam Profile</a> If youre curious about what i may be playing lately!</p>
                <p>However it would probably lead you to believe at least by my most played, that my favorites are
                    things like Newer COD titles.
                    Albeit some of the most played games on my profile do probably make the cut for my all time favs,
                    Steam isnt inclusive of titles, well, not on steam!
                    If i were really pressed to choose say 5 <em>Video Games</em> in no particular order as my favs i
                    would say...
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Terraria</li>
                    <li>Persona 5</li>
                    <li>.Hack Infection</li>
                    <li>COD: Black Ops 2</li>
                    <li>World of Warcraft (VANILLA)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="card-games">However, though i absolutely love playing games on my computer and consoles, my
                    all time fav way to
                    game is over the table via TTRPGs like D&amp;D.
                    As well as TCGs like Magic the Gathering, or more importantly as of late, the One Piece Card
                    Game.<br>
                    I started my TCG journey back with Magic the Gathering with the release of Scars of Mirrodin, and
                    have been playing ever since.
                    Though for many people Trading card games are just a way to make money or pass time, for me they are
                    a way to connect with people.
                    I have met so many amazing people through TCGs, and have made some of my best friends through them.
                    <br>I think i really fell in love with the game around the release of Theros block in 2013, when i
                    found the great world of competitive play.
                    For one reason or another Magic fell out of favor for me, I still play commander and a bit of Modern
                    from time to time, casually.
                    <br>However, I have found a new love in the One Piece Card Game. I started playing it in 2023, and
                    have been hooked ever since.
                    I love the art, the mechanics, and the community. I have made so many friends through this game, and
                    I am so excited to see where it goes in the future.
                    After moving to a new city, and leaving behind many of my friends, i was worried about how i would
                    find a new community and friends.
                    I was so happy to find a local game store that hosts weekly events for a game at the time i'd never
                    heard of One piece.<br>
                    Funnily enough, I had never actually watched One Piece, but i was so intrigued by the game that i
                    decided to give it a shot!
                    Since then i've played in a multitude of events, and garnered quite the commendable collection of
                    winner cards!

                <h2>Favorite Shows &amp; Movies</h2>
                <p>My favorite shows and movies are a bit all over the place, but I love anything that has a good story
                    and
                    interesting characters.
                    <br><br>Some of my favorites include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>One Piece <em>(suprise suprise)</em></li>
                    <li>Yu Yu Hakusho</li>
                    <li>Better Call Saul</li>
                    <li>The Princess Bride</li>
                    <li>Good Will Hunting</li>
                </ul>
