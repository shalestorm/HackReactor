                <p>Hello! I'm Skyler, a passionate coder and gamer. I love working on creative projects that blend tech
                    and
                    fun.
                    When I'm not coding, you can find me playing tabletop games or spending too much time at my
                    computer.<br><br>My hobbies as of late are primarily competitive TCG's such as MTG and OPTCG.
                    And striving to excel my knowledge in Software engineering.
                    <br><br>Currently im doing so via a coding bootcamp through Hack Reactor, but i also have a college
                    background
                    In Computer science.

                <p>
                    I started to take piano lessons when i was 9 years old, and have been playing ever since.
                    In my gradeschool years i picked up the trumpet as a part of band class, and play that to this day
                    as well.
                    <br>In highschool i eventually joined both marching band, and jazz band, in addition to our
                    Orchestral band.
                    Though I primarily stuck with trumpet, the skillset and love led to me to try multiple other brass
                    instruments,
                    such as trombone, and the french horn.
                    I never quite fell in love with read instruments the same way as brass, however i did take the time
                    to learn enough
                    to get in trouble on the sax. The same is true of string instruments, of which i have
                    dabbled in guitar, mandolin, and violin.
                    <br>In addition to my love of music, I also have a passion for acting. I have been in multiple
                    plays and musicals.
                    The favorites of which were Sancho Panza in "Man of La Mancha", and Huck Finn in "The adventures of
                    Tom Saywer".
                    I also have a love of improv, and have been a part of multiple improv groups.
                    <br>Though these are largely passion driven skills. The skills i have learned from them have
                    been invaluable.
                    I have learned how to work as a team, as well as a fleshed out skillset of social skills.

                    I have a wide range of interests, but my main focus is on gaming and coding. I love to play
                    tabletop games, especially Dungeons and Dragons. I also enjoy playing video games, particularly
                    RPGs and strategy games. In addition to gaming, I have a passion for coding and software
                    development. I'm always looking for new projects to work on and new technologies to learn.
